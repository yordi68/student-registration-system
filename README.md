# Student Management Stystem

## Overview

This Student Management System is built using Node.js and follows a **microservice architecture** to keep things simple and flexible. The system is divided into separate independent services, each handling specific tasks. Each service uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern.

The system has 4 services, namely the Student, Registration, Teacher and Notidication services. Registration Service is tasked with registering or updating students information about the accademic year. Teacher Service is involved in teacher infomration. Student service is where all the infomration is stored about the student. Notification Service sends updates, reminders and announcements to the students.

All services are independent and follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Communication between services is facilitated through well-defined APIs.

### Architectural Patterns

- **MVC (Model-View-Controller)**: Used for Node.js-based services to maintain separation of concerns:

  - **Model**: Handles data and business logic.
  - **View**: Responsible for presenting the output (not directly applicable for backend APIs).
  - **Controller**: Processes incoming requests and delegates logic to the service layer.



## Services Overview

### 1. Driver Service (Node.js, MVC)

- **Purpose**: Manages driver data, onboarding, and statuses.
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Driver registration and management.
  - Real-time status updates (e.g., availability).

### 2. User Service (Node.js, MVC)

- **Purpose**: Handles user authentication and profile management.
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - User registration and login.
  - Managing user profiles and preferences.

### 3. Ride Service (Django, MTV)

- **Purpose**: Manages ride requests, matching, and ride tracking.
- **Technology**: Django, Python.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Matching drivers to users based on proximity and availability.
  - Ride status management (e.g., booked, ongoing, completed).

### 4. Payment Service (Node.js, MVC)

- **Purpose**: Processes payments and handles transactions securely.
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Payment gateway integration.
  - Transaction tracking and refunds.

### 5. Notification Service (Node.js, MVC)

- **Purpose**: Sends real-time notifications to users and drivers.
- **Technology**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Multi-channel notifications (Email, Telegram).
  - Customizable notification templates.

### 6. Analytics and Reporting Service (Nest.js, MVC)

- **Purpose**: Generates analytics and reports for business insights.
- **Technology**: Nest.js, TypeScript.
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Collecting and analyzing service data.
  - Generating usage reports and KPIs.

## Communication

- **Inter-Service Communication**:

  - Services communicate via REST APIs.
  - Asynchronous messaging (e.g., RabbitMQ or Kafka) is planned for event-driven operations.

- **Data Sharing**:
  - Each service maintains its own database for a decentralized approach.
  - APIs are used to share required data between services.

## Technology Stack

| Service                  | Technology            | Architecture |
| ------------------------ | --------------------- | ------------ |
| **Driver Service**       | Node.js, Express, MVC | MVC          |
| **User Service**         | Node.js, Express, MVC | MVC          |
| **Ride Service**         | Django, MTV           | MTV          |
| **Payment Service**      | Node.js, Express, MVC | MVC          |
| **Notification Service** | Node.js, Express, MVC | MVC          |
| **Analytics Service**    | Nest.js, MVC          | MVC          |

## Scalability and Fault Tolerance

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Each service can be scaled independently.
- **Database Isolation**: Each service uses a dedicated database to ensure autonomy.
- **Resilience**: Services are loosely coupled to prevent cascading failures.

---

## Security

- **Authentication**: User and driver authentication via secure tokens (e.g., JWT).
- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- **API Gateway**: Centralized API gateway for secure communication and routing.

---

## Installation and Deployment

### Prerequisites

- Docker (recommended for containerized deployment).
- Node.js, Python, and PostgreSQL installed locally (if not using Docker).

### Steps

1. Clone the repositories for all services.

   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Set up `.env` files for each service with appropriate configurations.

3. Run services:

   - Using Docker Compose:
     ```bash
     docker-compose up
     ```
   - Or manually start each service:
     ```bash
     npm start # Node.js services
     python manage.py runserver # Django service
     ```

4. Access APIs via the centralized API Gateway or directly at their respective endpoints.

## Future Improvements

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Introduce message queues for inter-service communication.
- **Load Balancing**: Implement load balancers to distribute traffic.
- **Push Notifications**: Integrate push notification services (e.g., Firebase).
